The (stein) score function is the gradient of the log probability density function $\nabla_x\log(p(x))$ . Note that this gradient is taken with respect to $x$ and not some model parameter $\theta$. The score function still includes all the information of the pdf since we can compute the integral from the score function.

Is a flexible model since it bypasses the normalizing constant and we can create score functions using principle statistical approaches

Has improved generation, higher quality samples and has a controllable generation process

Can calculate accurate probability evaluation of data points and has better estimation of data probabilities.
