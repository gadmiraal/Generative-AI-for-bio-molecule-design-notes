## Discrete Diffusion
[[Diffusion Model|Diffusion models]] are normally in set in a continuous setting where the original distribution with real values are transformed to a simple continuous distribution such as a Gaussian distribution. This raises some issues when we are trying to generate text with a fixed alphabet. To combat this, several solution can be used which all fall under discrete diffusion.
