### FiLM
FiLM, which stands for Feature-wise Linear Modulation, is a neural network conditioning method that adjusts intermediate feature maps using learned affine transformations. The key idea is to modulate the features of a neural network by applying linear transformations that are conditioned on some input, such as a task descriptor, an image, or a timestep.

The core concept of FiLM is to apply a feature-wise affine transformation to the feature maps of a neural network. For each feature map FFF in the network, FiLM can apply a scaling factor $\gamma$$ and/or a bias $\beta$
$$
\text{FiLM}(F;\gamma, \beta)=\gamma \odot F + \beta
$$
