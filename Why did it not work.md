Training on protein sequences using d3pm minimal with a T5 decoder modified by me with inspiration taken from original d3pm paper showed
- highly noisy loss curves 
- small gradient updates
- stagnent paramter norm 

Overtraining on simple sequence using d3pm minimal with my T5 and with a transformer encoder created for diffusion showed that
- Highly noisy loss curves
