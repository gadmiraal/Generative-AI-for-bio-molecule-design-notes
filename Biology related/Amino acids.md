## What are they?
Amino acids have an **amino group** on one end of their structure and a **carboxyl group** on the other. The carbon that is between these groups is called the **alpha carbon**, $C_\alpha$, and bares a side chain (often denoted as R). All amino acids thus have the same three-atom backbone $N-C_\alpha-C$ but having a varying side chain. Its structure can be seen in figure 1 below

The amino acids are classified depending on its side chain. In total there are twenty different possible sidechains and thus 20 different possible amino acids. The side chain also influences the amino acids characteristic such as hydrophobic, aromatic, basic, acidic, etc.. 

Amino acids are the building blocks of [[Proteins]]. When hundreds to thousands of amino acids chain together through peptide bonds they form these complex macro molecules. 
### Essential Amino Acids
The human body cannot make all these 20 amino acids itself and must thus consume the necessary amino acids. The 9 amino acids that the human body cannot make are called essential amino acids. The other 11 we can make are called the non essential amino acids
### Polarity and Charge
Polarity and charge are crucial properties of amino acids, profoundly influencing the structure, function, and interactions of proteins. In terms of polarity, hydrophilic polar amino acids are soluble in water, facilitating essential biological processes. The distribution of polar and nonpolar amino acids in a protein sequence dictates its three-dimensional structure, with polar residues typically found on the protein surface, interacting with water molecules. These interactions are vital for proper protein folding and stability. Additionally, polar amino acids form hydrogen bonds with other molecules, contributing to the overall stability of protein structures and mediating various molecular interactions.

Charge, on the other hand, plays a pivotal role in the pH sensitivity of amino acids. Some amino acid side chains can change their charge state depending on the pH of the surrounding environment, a characteristic important for enzymes and proteins in different cellular compartments with varying pH levels. Charged amino acids participate in electrostatic interactions crucial for the formation and stabilization of protein-protein complexes. In enzyme active sites, charged amino acids contribute to catalysis by stabilizing intermediate reaction states or interacting with substrates. Furthermore, charged amino acids are involved in signal transduction pathways, where changes in charge status transmit signals within the cell, influencing diverse cellular responses. The interplay of polarity and charge adds a layer of complexity to the versatility of proteins and their biological functions.

## Evolution

## Non-standard amino acids (nsAA)
Non-standard amino acids (nsAA) are amino acids which fall outside of the twenty amino acids fairly universally found throughout biology (There are actually an additional 2 amino acids, [selenocysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenocysteine "Selenocysteine") and [pyrrolysine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrolysine "Pyrrolysine"), that can be incorporated by special translation mechanisms). The chemical properties of the standard 22 amino acids are limited and a lot of them posses side chains with very similar structure and chemical properties. This leaves a lot of unexplored space in protein design, because a lot of chemical groups are not available in the pool of amino acids that can be naturally incorporated into proteins by translation. 
Creating new nsAA with novel side chains can be very diverse and potentially lead to proteins with before unimaginable functions. So far more than 150 nsAAs have been incorporated with a wide range of function[^1] .
