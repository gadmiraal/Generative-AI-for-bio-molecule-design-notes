Atom-by-atom representation involves the detailed description of each specific atom within a molecule, encompassing information about its bonds, rings, aromaticity, branching, and stereochemistry. This level of granularity is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of molecular structures. [[Proteins]] sequences can either be represented by their sequence of [[Amino acids]] or using the atom-by-atom approach. 

## Representation
There are two main ways of representing molecules in software: SMILES and SELFIES.
### SMILES 
SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is one of the most prominent sequence representations in atom-by-atom encoding. It provides a concise and human-readable way to represent chemical structures. In SMILES notation, each atom and bond is explicitly specified, capturing the connectivity and arrangement of atoms in a molecule. SMILES strings are known for their robustness and validity, making them a valuable tool for molecular representation and manipulation.
### SELFIES 
SELFIES (Self-referencing Embedded Strings) is another notable sequence representation employed in atom-by-atom encoding. Similar to SMILES, SELFIES strings offer a concise and unambiguous representation of molecular structures. What sets SELFIES apart is its self-referencing capability, allowing for a more compact representation of complex molecular patterns. SELFIES strings are designed to be always valid, providing a reliable means of encoding diverse molecular structures.
