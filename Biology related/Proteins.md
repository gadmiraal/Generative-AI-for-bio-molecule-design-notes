## What are they made of?
### Amino Acids
Proteins are complex polymer biomolecules comprised out of repeating monomer molecules called [[Amino acids]] (AA). Amino acids have an **amino group** on one end of their structure and a **carboxyl group** on the other. The carbon that is between these groups is called the **alpha carbon**, $C_\alpha$, and bares a side chain (often denoted as R). All amino acids thus have the same three-atom backbone $N-C_\alpha-C$ but having a varying side chain. Its structure can be seen in figure 1 below

*Figure 1. Generic amino acid structure*

The amino acids are classified depending on its side chain. In total there are twenty different possible sidechains and thus 20 different possible amino acids. The side chain also influences the amino acids characteristic such as hydrophobic, aromatic, basic, acidic, etc.. 
#### Essential Amino Acids
The human body cannot make all these 20 amino acids itself and must thus consume the necessary amino acids. The 9 amino acids that the human body cannot make are called essential amino acids. The other 11 we can make are called the non essential amino acids
### Peptide Bonds
Amino acids polymerize when they form peptide bonds with one another. A peptide bond formation is a dehydration reaction. This happens since one amino acid will loose an OH molecule and the other amino acid will loose a H atom which results in a water molecule (H<sub>2</sub>O) being formed.
When two or more amino acids are combined they form an **amino acid residue**. The combination of two amino acids is called a dipeptide, the combination of 3-10 amino acids is called a oligopeptide and the combination of more than 10 amino acids is called a polypeptide. Proteins are large polypeptides of 300 to a 1000 amino acids. The way these long chains are folded, i.e. their structure, influences their biological activity and function. 
#### Peptide Planes
Due to resonance can the peptide bond take on two forms depending on the environment. One form has a double bond going from the Carbon atom to the Oxygen atom, both in the carboxyl group. The other form has a double bond going from the Carbon atom in the carboxyl group to the Nitrogen atom in the amino group. This second form has as a result that the Nitrogen atom, from the amino group, is positively charged and the Oxygen atom, in the carboxyl group, is negatively charged. Additionally, the second form has a rigid and planar structure due to aforementioned differences.
When the peptide bond is in the more rigid form then the peptide bond and the two adjacent $C_\alpha$ atoms are arranged in a single plane which is called a **peptide plane**

The rotation around the peptide bond is called $\omega$ which is closely restricted to $180^\circ$ in trans configuration and $0^\circ$ in cis configuration. In trans configuration the $C_\alpha$ atoms are opposite of each other while in in cis configuration they are on the same side as can be seen in figure 2. The cis configuration is more rare.

#### Dihedral angles
The architecture of a protein depends upon the orientation of the peptide planes of one another. The rotation angles which determine the orientation of the peptide planes are called **dihedral angles**. The angle around the $N-C_\alpha$ bond is denoted as $\phi$ and the angle around the $C-C_\alpha$ bond is denoted as $\psi$. The angles, $\phi$ and $\psi$ are not restricted to $180^\circ$ because they are the rotation angles of a single bond unlike the $\omega$ angle from the peptide bond. These dihedral angles can thus facilitate protein molecules to attain different conformations. Furthermore, to these angles follow an established distribution known as the Ramachandran distribution. The three peptide torsion angles can be seen in figure 3

## How is protein structure defined?

##### Primary Structure
The primary structure of a protein is simply the sequence of amino acids. It takes no notion of the proteins 3D shape. This sequence of the amino acids determines the ultimate 3D shape of the protein. The sequence of each amino acid side chain determines the way the protein folds up
##### Secondary Structure
The secondary structure describes localized conformation of the chain. This means the folding pattern the protein has over a few dozen amino acid residues. The secondary structure is described by the dihedral torsion angles of the backbone. This structure can be described by certain motifs where the most common ones are the beta-pleated sheet and the alpha helix. The beta-pleated sheet is often denoted as an arrow where as the alpha helix is denoted as a coil. Colour is used as a visual guidance between the different secondary structures.
##### Tertiary Structure
Tertiary folding describes the further complex folding of the polypeptide chain. If a protein is highly folded we call it a globular protein and if it is long and spindly we call it a fibrous protein
##### Quaternary Structure
Some proteins are just one single polypeptide chain where as others are a combination of separate polypeptide subunits. The arrangements of these subunits determines the quaternary structure of the protein. If a protein does not consists of a combination of polypeptide subunits than it does not have a quaternary structure, An example of such a combination of polypeptides is haemoglobin. 
## Static vs Dynamic nature of proteins
When studying the structure of proteins this is often done in a static nature. For example when a protein is crystalized to study its structure this is of course done statically. Also when we try to predict a proteins structure we end up with a static structure. However, a protein is not static when it is inside an organism. Small deviations in its structure are dependent on its environment and causes it to be dynamic. This dynamicity makes the protein prediction problem even more complex.
## Protein Symmetry
Symmetry refers to the repetitive placement of similar objects within a spatial context. This can be done by a combination of the four operations: translation, rotation, mirror-reflection and glide reflection. It can be demonstrated that there are a total of 230 possible arrangements for placing identical objects in 3D space. 
Since proteins are **chiral or asymmetric** objects and cannot be inverted whilst remaining the same. This means that the mirror operation is invalid and we can only adopt 65 of the possible 3D space groups.
## Protein Properties
- **Binding Affinity** is how great the attractive forces are between a binding molecule or ligand and a protein or its receptor. A high affinity binding results in a higher occupancy of the receptor by its ligand
- **Aggregation tendency** refers to the fact of how likely mis-folded or intrinsically-disordered proteins aggregate to each other. Protein aggregation is know to be correlated to a wide variety of diseases
- **Expression yield** describes how well a protein can be expressed and thus relates to the amount of proteins can can expect to obtain
- **Temperature degradation** describes at which temperature the protein degrades
- **Temperature expression**, a protein can also exhibit different structures and thus functions at different temperatures
## What is a proteins function?
A lot of things ðŸ¥´
[[Wu, Kevin E., et al. Protein structure generation via folding diffusion.pdf]]
	from relaying signals across neurons (Zhou et al., 2017) to recognizing microscopic invaders and subsequently activating the immune response (Mariuzza et al., 1987), from producing energy for cells (Bonora et al., 2012) to transporting molecules along cellular highways (Dominguez & Holmes, 2011). Misbehaving proteins, on the other hand, cause some of the most challenging ailments in human healthcare, including Alzheimerâ€™s disease, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, Huntingtonâ€™s disease, and cystic fibrosis (Chaudhuri & Paul, 2006).
## Protein motif and scaffolds
In protein design, scaffolds serve as a stable framework that supports the structural integrity of a specific motif, where motifs are functional protein fragments that contribute to biological functions
within the stable structure of the scaffold.
## Protein families
### Antibodies
CDR
Heavy/Light Chain
Antigen

## Binding to other molecules
Proteins interact with various molecules, such as ligands, antigens, and other proteins. Protein functionality often relies on specific interactions with other molecules. Understanding and harnessing these interactions is crucial for the development of novel therapeutics and biotechnological applications. An example of a protein binding to a ligand can be seen in the figure 5 below.
